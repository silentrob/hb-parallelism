harp.io | @HarpPlatform

This template has been modified to work with the [@HarpPlatform](http://twitter.com/HarpPlatform) and [@HarpWebServer](http://twitter.com/HarpWebServer), they contain partials and layouts so the code is easier to manage and dry. You can put this template online in seconds with the [Harp Platform](https://www.harp.io), or run it locally with the [Harp WebServer](http://harpjs.com).

It's done! Parallelism was an idea I mocked up a few months ago but, due to other
committments, didn't get around to putting to code until recently. Different to
my more general-purpose freebies, this one's specifically built for portfolio use
but still delivers quite a bit of customizability (via CSS and a number of settings).
For more on how it works and how to make the most of it, jump on down to the 
"Instructions" section.

Instructions
============
	

	Terminology
	-----------
	
		- Item: A generic container of stuff. Said stuff can be a thumbnail, the actual
		  page header, or whatever else you deem item worthy. Items can vary in width but
		  are all the same height (230px by default, but you can change this with a setting).
		  
		- Thumb: A special type of item that contains a thumbnail image and a title. Short
		  for thumbnail. No relation to actual nails.
		  
		- Reel: A whole bunch of items strung together, and the main point of interaction
		  for users.
	

	How it Works
	------------
	
		1. You (the user) add a bunch of items to the reel. Items must be assigned a width
		   (in pixels) using the "data-width" attribute. A few examples:

				Generic
				-------

					<div class="item" data-width="300">
						This is a generic item. Put whatever you want here.
					</div>
					
					(width = whatever you want)
					
				Thumbnail
				---------
				
					<article class="item thumb" data-width="275">
						<h2>Image Title</h2>
						<a href="path/to/fullsize.jpg"><img src="path/to/thumbnail.jpg" alt=""></a>
					</article>
				
					(width = width of the thumbnail image)
				
				Page Header (which, by the way, is entirely optional)
				-----------------------------------------------------

					<div id="header" class="item" data-width="400">
						<h1>Parallelism</h1>
						<p>A responsive portfolio site<br />
						template by HTML5 UP</p>
					</div>
					
					(width = whatever you want)

		   Congratulations. You now have a reel full of items.

		2. Parallelism looks at the window, figures out how many rows it can fit in the
		   available (vertical) space, then breaks up the reel into that many rows.
		 
		3. With the reel broken up, Parallelism goes through and does a bit of scaling
		   on each item to ensure the widths of each row are identical.
		   
		4. Profit !@#!#%$(!$%(*

		So yeah, pretty simple. Also, tons of settings to mess with if you're into that
		sort of thing (below).


	Notes
	-----
	
		- Scrolling is handled in 3 ways:
		
			1. Scrolling up/down using the mouse wheel (down = scroll right, up = scroll left)
			2. Using the left/right arrow keys ("Scroll Keys")
			3. Moving the mouse cursor to the far left or far right of the screen ("Scroll Zones")
	
			Methods #2 and #3 can be disabled and customized using settings (below). Method #1
			is always enabled.
	
		- If you don't have enough items to require scrolling, the reel will just be centered on
		  the screen.
		
		- Rows will automatically factor when the viewport is resized.

		- All modern desktop/mobile browsers are supported (as well as IE as far back as 8, though
		  7 is still pretty usable).
